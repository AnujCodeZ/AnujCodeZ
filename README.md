# Hi I'm Anuj Rana.

- I'm passionate about Machine Learning (more in Deep Learning). 
- My journey in Machine Learning starts in 2018, when I first made a project Attendence System Using Face Recognition.
- Now I'm experiences in Pytorch and TensorFlow. 
- I really like JARVIS from Iron Man when I was in 10th standard, from then I wanted to build him (not it). 
- So now I'm currently studying NLP and speech Recognition.
