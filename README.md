# Hi I'm Anuj Rana.

> I'm passionate about Machine Learning (more in Deep Learning). My journey in Machine Learning starts in 2018, when I first made a project [](Attendence System Using Face Recognition), and now I'm experiences in Pytorch and TensorFlow. I really like JARVIS from Iron Man when I was in 10th standard, from then I wanted to build him (not it). So now I'm currently studying NLP and speech Recognition.
