# Hi I'm Anuj Rana.

- I'm passionate about Machine Learning (more in Deep Learning). 
- My journey in Machine Learning starts in 2018, when I first made a project [Attendence System Using Face Recognition](https://github.com/AnujCodeZ/AttendenceSystemUsingFaceRecognition).
- Now I'm experienced in Pytorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, etc.
- I really like JARVIS from Iron Man when I was in 10th standard, from then I wanted to build him (not it). 
- So now I'm currently studying NLP and speech Recognition.
- Also I start learning MLOps (ML in production).
- You can see my from scratch algorithms of [ML](https://github.com/AnujCodeZ/PyML) and [DL](https://github.com/AnujCodeZ/PyNet).
